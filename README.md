## Description of the project: 
I created an xkcd password generator that allows the user to generate a
random password based on preferences they can set. The user specifies
how many words in the password (up to 8) and whether or not they want the 
first letter capitalized, the first word capitalized, a symbol, or a number.

## Demo information: 
I will be demoing my xkcd password generator in Jeremy's 7:30-9pm virtual class on 
Wednesday, October 8.

## Additional info:
I pulled the words I used in my common.ini file from a list of 4000 most 
common English words. You can find the resource here: http://www.rupert.id.au/resources/1000-words.php
I also downloaded some western fonts to match my Wild Wild West theme. Looks 
a little hokey, but I wanted to play around with background images and fonts
and I really had fun with this project.
